# Social media networks

The default configuration for the `share-button` is to render a pop up menu with sharing options. However, it's also possible to output individual share buttons for your social media network of choice.

To enable individual buttons, use the `atomic` attribute.

```html
<share-button atomic></share-button>
```

<div class="sb-container">
<share-button atomic></share-button>
</div>

<script>
    import "@royalfig/share-button"
</script>
